# FixItYourself

#### Description: 'Do you really need to visit a service centre for that?'
This simple web-application asks for user's electronics' brand and issue type and helps them fix it through either listing out the solution stepwise using hugging face's ai summariser or simply redirects them to a helpful youtube video, using reddit and google as the relevant video/text sources

since i was asked for more details : this project, called 'fixityourself,' is a web app designed to help users troubleshoot issues with their devices. the project structure includes directories for the app's static files, templates, and necessary python modules. the backend uses flask and sql alchemy for the web framework and database interaction, while the frontend consists of html and css files for the user interface.
